## Bundu.io Development

### Autobuilding

Autobuilding is set up separately for client and server.

Start autobuilding for the client:

```
npm run client
```

Start autobuilding for the server:

```
npm run server
```

Keep in mind that in order to autobuild both, you need two terminal instances.
